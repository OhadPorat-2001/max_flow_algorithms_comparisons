# Max Flow Comparisons
A git for the project for an optimization course

We present an implementation of 3 algorithms:
- Ford–Fulkerson (Edmonds–Karp)
- Dinic
- Push relabel
For the comparison we also measure time for each algorithm.

### Dataset
We run them on a dataset of contiguous USA states, as taken from https://github.com/odubno/ford-fulkerson-max-flow, and measure the performance of the various min-cut-max-flow algorithms.
